🏃‍♂️ AI-Powered Sports Performance & Cheating Detection System
🚀 Project Overview

This project is an AI-driven sports analytics platform designed to track, analyze, and validate athletic performance in sprinting and jumping activities.

The system integrates GPS-based activity tracking with computer vision and machine learning models to:

Track sprint performance using real-world activity data

Measure jump performance using pose estimation

Detect cheating attempts using AI models

Provide performance analytics and insights

The goal is to create a fair, data-driven competitive sports evaluation system that reduces manual judging errors and prevents manipulation.
